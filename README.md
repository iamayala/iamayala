<h1>Hi There, I am <a  href="https://iamayala.github.io/">Serge Mayala</a> </h1>

I am a software engineer based in Kigali, Rwanda and I currently working for a cool company that builds software.

I am passionate about developing highly scalable, resilient applications. I love everything from the database, to microservices, to the frontend. I find amazing to think about how all pieces work together to provide a fast and pleasurable experience to end users, mainly because they have no clue how complex that "simple" app is.
